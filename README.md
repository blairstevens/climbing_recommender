#### climbing_recommender

All of the work behind my climbing route recommender heroku app.

The running app can be found at https://route-demo.herokuapp.com/. It will work on any North American climbing route if formatted properly, however the autocomplete will only run for routes in Squamish, Yosemite, Horseshoe Canyon Ranch, Mt Nemo, or Red Rocks areas. It will return 5 routes recommended to you based on the route you indicate.
